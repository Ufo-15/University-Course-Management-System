This project is a University Course Management System designed to efficiently handle and organize academic data related to students, instructors, courses, and enrollments. It focuses on demonstrating relational database design, SQL querying, and data management concepts used in real-world academic systems.

The system allows users to:

Manage students, instructors, departments, and courses with proper relational integrity.

Perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on university data.

Execute SQL queries for tasks such as:

Listing students enrolled in multiple courses

Displaying top courses with the highest enrollments

Retrieving instructor and department statistics

Calculating average marks per course

Identifying students not enrolled in any course

The database schema includes well-defined relationships between entities using primary and foreign keys, ensuring data consistency and normalization.
